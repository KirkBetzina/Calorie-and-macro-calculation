## Project Description

Developing a tool for those who want to get their diet in control and dont know what or how to eat to achieve their lifestyle goals. 

## API

From the returned data we will be able to see the some of the data depending on the endpoints. Such as :


```
 
         
```


## Wireframes/ UX DESIGN COMP





### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- data input for height, weight, and age
- BMR Calculator
- diet planner



#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- JWT



Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav in tablet and desktop media queries| 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav for mobile only | 
| Cards | This is where the relevant Calorie and macro information will be displayed.| 


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Working with API | H | 5hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Working with Nav | H | 5hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Styling | H | 5hrs | hrs | hrs |
| Bulding Base App structure| H | 11hrs | hrs | hrs |
| PostMVP Stuff| L | 1hrs | hrs | hrs |
| Project Planning | H | 5hrs | hrs | hrs- |
| Backend | H | 4hrs | hrs | hrs |
| Total | H | 40hrs| hrs | hrs |

## Additional Libraries
Reactstrap
As of now. may grow or change at the flow of the project.

## Code Snippet

This code snippet dynamically generates 3 cards. Im proud of it because I was able to make it work.
