# Calorie-and-macro-calculation

Your Base Metabolic Rate is the most important piece of info you will need in order to design meal plans for yourself, or to help a friend. This number is specific to you, and you alone. BMR is how many calories your body burns just to sustain life. I personally like this one (https://www.calculator.net/bmr-calculator.html). OK, buckle up, there's gonna be a lot of information coming at you, I'll do my best to keep it easy to understand. 

There's 3 macronutrients that we measure in order to keep track of daily totals for our goals. Fat, Carbohydrate, Protein. Protein and Carbohydrate(let's call them carbs from now on) have 4 calories per gram. Oh yea, we get metric lol. Fat has 9 calories per gram. You may be wondering how much protein is in cooked meat. I'm glad you asked. Cooked meats tend to have 6g of protein  per oz. So 10oz of chicken has 60g protein. 

What I don't want people do to is think fats and carbs are bad. They're absolutely necessary and GOOD FOR YOU! One thing you will not see a lot of in a clean meal plan is sugar. This is going to be tough for folks. You will have to look at a nutrition label and look to see how much sugar is hiding in things. Anything over 4-6g of added sugar I would suggest staying away from. You will get an insulin response and this will increase the fat storage potential. This tool will allow you to build muscle and lose fat at the same time, so we want to do our best by allowing our body the ability to do it. Don't Worry, you will still be able to eat any of your favorite foods! Trust me, I would die if I couldn't eat cake anymore. There's just specific times when I eat those kinds of foods, and they help me instead of hurt me. Who would have thought, eating ice cream would get you abs?! I know, me too. We will discuss this in a little bit, because it's an important part in keeping our body and our minds running optimally.
Cheat meals!!! Yes, and never feel guilty for it either haha. Your body has these gas tanks of glycogen, sugar is what fills these up. You will know when you have depleted these stores because you will feel absolutely exhausted. Your legs will feel like a 1000lbs a piece. It takes a few weeks to a month of good diet and exercise to get to this point while not eating any added sugars. It's at this time, you will need to get a cheat meal in you. Eat whatever you want, for 1 meal. It's going to be amazing I can promise.

So here's how we make a sustainable, healthy, and long term meal plan for ourselves that teaches us about food, and ourselves. In this case the figures are based off of my own BMR:

BMR = 2,534 calories

Now here's where the math comes in and it's pretty cool. 

I personally like:
- 65% of my calories to come from protein
- 30% of my calories to come from carbs
- and the remaining fats % is naturally occuring in meats. So I don't typically add fats to my meals. 

- .60 x 2543 calories = 1526 calories protein
- .35 x 2543 calories = 890 calories carbs
- .05 x 2543 calories = 127 calories fats

now we need to convert calories to grams for each of our macros:

- 1526 calories protein / 4 = 381.5g of protein
- 890 calories carbs / 4 = 222.5g of carbs
- 127 calories fats / 9 =  14g of fats 

Great! Now we have our daily need for macros that is for what we call maintenance, this is no surplus or deficit. I will not gain or lose any weight eating this diet. My body composition will change however. So, now that we have brought up calorie deficits, A lot of people jump in waaay too far. I would suggest only starting at a 200 calories deficit for a couple reasons. You're already making a big change in the way you eat and going too fast will cause some issues. One, in the way your body is going to react. you will lose weight and fast, but you cannot eat like this forever, it's not sustainable. Two, you will plateau in your weight loss, and what do you to lose more weight, take out more calories. But you've already taken out 500 calories, and you can't afford to take anymore out. This is usually where people's "Diets" fail. Causing them to gain back all the weight they lost and some. With a 200 calorie deficit, not only is it easy to sustain but if you hit a plateau you have room to move. Since 1 pound of fat is 3500 calories, we know that a 200 calorie deficit aided with exercise should allow you a 2.5 pounds of weight loss a week. Any more than this, it can start to become unhealthy. 

Now let's make this meal plan:

- 381.5g protein / 6 meals a day = 63g protein per meal
- 222.5g carbs / 6 meals a day = 37g carbs per meal
- 14g fats / 6 meals a day = 2g f per meal (see why now I don't add fats, the naturally occurring fats make up your daily needs)

Now you have the basic layout for developing a healthier meal plan and lifestyle for yourself! Feel free to play around with the percentages of macros too, but keep in mind that A higher protein and lower carb/fat diet is what is going to allow you to build muscle and burn fat at the same time. I wish you luck on your fitness journey! A note for women, having more than 55% of your calories from protein has shown increased chances of kidney stones.
